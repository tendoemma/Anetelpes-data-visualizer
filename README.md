# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Project Description

This project is a web application that visualizes data related to antelope species. It provides a comparison tool for users to compare different antelope species. The backend is built using Node.js, which serves as the data source for the frontend React application. The frontend utilizes React.js along with Material-UI for building the user interface.

## Environment

- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI
- **Bundler**: Vite



## Launching the Node Server

In order to set the Node.js server ready, you can integrate it with the frontend by following these steps:

1. Install the required backend dependencies (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the Node.js server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

## Launching the React app 
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```


Now you have both the React app and the Node server running simultaneously.
